# Dungeon Crawl - GWJ

A fork of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup for the GWJ community to mod and inevitably break terribly.

## License and history information

Crawl is licensed as GPLv2+. See [licence.txt](crawl-ref/licence.txt) for the full text.

Crawl is a descendant of Linley's Dungeon Crawl. Development of the main branch stalled at version 4.0.0b26, with a final alpha of 4.1 being released by Brent Ross in 2005. Since 2006, the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup team has continued development. [CREDITS.txt](crawl-ref/CREDITS.txt) contains a full list of contributors.

Crawl gladly uses the following open source packages; thanks to their developers:

* The Lua scripting language, for in-game functionality and user macros ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lualicense.txt)).
* The PCRE library, for regular expressions ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/pcre_license.txt)).
* The SQLite library, as a database engine ([license](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)).
* The SDL and SDL_image libraries, for tiles display ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lgpl.txt)).
* The libpng library, for tiles image loading ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/libpng-LICENSE.txt)).

Thank you, and have fun crawling!
